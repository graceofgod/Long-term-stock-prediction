# Long term stock prediction
In this project, I used a Support Vector Regression (SVR) with RBF kernel to (1) predict whether a given stockâ€™s price on day t + m is higher or lower on day t, and (2) predict stock price on day t + m by using the information on day t. m is 20 business days. A hybrid analysis involving both Fundamental and Technical Analysis was used to provide input variables in order to learn the underlying patterns in the stock time series, and then Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to extract most important variables. I concluded that in the long-term, significant prediction accuracy can be achieved, compared with the short-term prediction.
